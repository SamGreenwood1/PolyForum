# PolyForum: Unified Forum Management App ðŸš€

PolyForum aims to solve the fragmentation and inefficiency of participating in multiple online forum communities. It provides a centralized, cross-platform application (Web, iOS, Android) to connect, browse, interact with, and monitor activity across various forum instances, beginning with Discourse.

## The Problem

Switching between numerous browser tabs or apps for different forums leads to information overload, missed notifications, and wasted time.

## The Solution

PolyForum offers:
*   **Unified Interface:** Connect all your forum accounts in one place.
*   **Custom Forum UI:** Experience faster, cleaner browsing with a native-like interface rendered directly via forum APIs (initially Discourse), avoiding sluggish WebViews.
*   **Aggregated "Deck" View:** Monitor latest topics, posts, mentions, and notifications across selected communities in customizable columns, similar to TweetDeck.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Built with modern web technologies for deployment on Web (PWA), iOS, and Android.

## Key Features

*   **Multiple Connections:** Add numerous forum instances.
*   **Native Interaction:** Read and participate in discussions seamlessly.
*   **Customizable Deck:** Tailor your aggregated view to your needs.
*   **Freemium Model:**
    *   **Free Tier:** Connect **unlimited Discourse** instances, full read/write access, standard Deck view, **manual JSON backup/sync** (config-only or full password-protected export/import).
    *   **Pro Tier (Planned):** Seamless **Cloud Sync**, support for **additional platforms** (XenForo, phpBB, etc.), **Admin/Moderator tools**, advanced Deck features, push notifications, and priority support.

## Status

Actively under development. The initial focus is on robust Discourse integration. Support for other platforms and Pro features are part of the future roadmap.
